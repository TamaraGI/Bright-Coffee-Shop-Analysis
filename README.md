This project provides a detailed data analysis of coffee shop sales, outlining a study to improve business performance. The primary objectives were to identify the most lucrative products, determine peak sales periods, and analyze sales trends to offer actionable recommendations.
The analysis, based on a dataset of transactions, involved a structured methodology from data cleaning to trend analysis. Key findings revealed that a small number of products drive a significant portion of the revenue. Specifically, the top five products—Barista coffee, brewed chai tea, hot chocolate, gourmet brewed coffee, and brewed black tea—account for a substantial 38.3% of total revenue. The data also pinpointed a clear sales peak, with the morning period (9 am to 12 pm) generating a remarkable 31.4% of all revenue. Interestingly, hot beverages like coffee and tea dominate early morning and morning sales, while light snacks like chocolate bars are notably slow-moving.
Based on these insights, the project offers several recommendations to optimize performance. These include strategic placement of high-revenue items to boost impulse buys, implementing targeted promotions during slower periods like the afternoon, and adjusting staffing schedules to ensure efficient service during peak hours. The analysis concludes that by focusing on these data-driven strategies, the coffee shop can significantly enhance its sales and overall profitability.
